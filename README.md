Clip Queue is a Vue application created to allow users to easily integrate with their [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) chat and accept clips pasted in chat. These clips are pasted in a queue and allows them to watch clip by clip through the webpage.

## Features
  - Simple login to connect to your Twitch chat and get started
  - Clip duplication prevented when multiple viewers are pasting the same clip link
  - Handles when a user was timed-out, banned, or had their message deleted by removing the clips they had pasted
  - Allows channel moderators to open/close the queue and move to the next/previous clip
  - Dark and light UI themes

## More Information
More information can be found in the respective doc in the docs folder.
